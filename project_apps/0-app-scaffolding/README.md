# App Scaffolding
This repository shows the basic structure of an Angular app, generated by the CLI using the ```ng new``` command, e.g., 

```
  ng new demo --skip-install --directory 0-app-scaffolding
``` 
Angular CLI provides a lot, which may seem overwhelming at first, but there are a lot of advantages to the CLI.

1. It eliminates the cumbersome task of creating a custom one-off build environment.
2. It provides a standard application architecture that aides team development.
3. It facilitates rapid development with generator commands for components, services, directives and more.

## Application Structure

#### Root files and resources generated with ng new
*	.git file
*	e2e directory: store end-to-end tests
*	node_modules directory: holds all the project dependencies
*	src directory: all of the code that comprises the application.
*	.angular-cli.json: manages general configuration settings for your project
*	.editorconfig: opensource cross-IDE configuration
*	.gitignore: determines which files and folders are not committed to git repository
*	karma.conf.js: controls testing
*	package.json: manages all project dependencies
*	package-lock.json: specifies tree structure, created when npm modifies node_modules or package.json: specifices the npm dependencies 
*	protractor.conf.js: supports testing also
*	README.md
*	tsconfig.json: determines how TypeScript is compiled
*	tslint.json: used for linting, checking that code is clean 

#### /src directories and files and resources generated with ng new
*	app directory: contains all the all source code
*	assets directory: used to store static assets
*	environments directory: allows for management of various environment variables
*	favicon.ico: browser icon for application
*	index.html: application host that contains the application root component
*	main.ts: contains code for starting/bootstrapping the application
*	polyfills.ts: manages polyfills that allow code to run in older browsers 
*	styles.css: used for global styles for the applciation
*	test.ts: used for tests
*	tsconfig.app.json: used for TypeScript compilation
*	tsconfig.spec.json: used for TypeScript compilation
