# Including The ArcGIS API for JavaScript


## Project Step #x: Description

This tutorial shows you how to integrate the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript), which is an enterprise geospatial API, using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

This repo demonstrates implementing a simple, extensible mapping component. Use this repo as a building block for adding in more advanced capabilities.


## Dependencies

This repo has the following dependencies:
* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
* [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/)
* [`esri-loader`](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader)
* [`arcgis-js-api.d.ts`](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/4.x/typescript) Esri TypeScript type definitions

## Build your project

If you are just getting started with Angular development, listed below are the steps for creating a simple Hello World mapping application with Angular CLI. 

Once you are comfortable with the getting started steps, feel free to explore building out the app using the rest of the `app.component` code. 

#### Clone or download this repo

```
  git clone https://github.com/andygup/angular-cli-esri-map.git
```

#### Install Angular CLI and generate a new project

Make sure you have Angular CLI installed. See the instructions here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli

* Now, let's generate your Angular project. Run the following commands in a terminal window or shell:

```
  ng new esri-app
  cd esri-app
  ng serve
```

* Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ and the basic app should run just fine. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If the app ran just fine, go ahead and shut down `ng serve` by doing a `Control-C`.


#### Install `esri-loader` and the Esri TypeScript types

We need [`esri-loader`](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader#usage) because it is a low level service that helps load ArcGIS JavaScript API modules (v3.x or v4.x) in non-Dojo applications.

And, the ArcGIS JavaScript TypeScript type definitions can be found [here](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/4.x/typescript).


```
  npm install --save esri-loader
  npm install --save @types/arcgis-js-api
```

#### Generate the scaffolding for your mapping component

```
  ng generate component esri-map
  
  //or you can also use shorthand
  
  ng g component esri-map
```


* Copy the contents from the `angular-cli-esri-map/src/app/esri-map` folder into the `esri-app/src/app/esri-map` directory.

* Add the following code to the bottom of the `app.component.html` file.

```
  <app-esri-map></app-esri-map>
```

* In `tsconfig.app.json` add `"types": ["arcgis-js-api"]`. 

* In `tsconfig.spec.json` add `"types": ["arcgis-js-api"]`. 


#### Make sure the mapping app runs

Now run the following command and you should see our mapping appear on the page.

```
  ng serve
```

If you see the mapping app and it runs without errors go ahead and shutdown `ng serve` with a `Control C`.

#### Build our spec and run it to make sure everything is good

Copy `app.component.spec.ts` into the `/app` directory.

```
  import { TestBed, async } from '@angular/core/testing';
  import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
  import { EsriMapComponent } from './esri-map/esri-map.component';
  
  describe('AppComponent', () => {
    beforeEach(async(() => {
      TestBed.configureTestingModule({
        declarations: [
          AppComponent,
          EsriMapComponent
        ],
      }).compileComponents();
    }));
    it('should create the app', async(() => {
      const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
      const app = fixture.debugElement.componentInstance;
      expect(app).toBeTruthy();
    }));
    it(`should have as title 'app'`, async(() => {
      const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
      const app = fixture.debugElement.componentInstance;
      expect(app.title).toEqual('app');
    }));
    it('should render title in a h1 tag', async(() => {
      const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
      fixture.detectChanges();
      const compiled = fixture.debugElement.nativeElement;
      expect(compiled.querySelector('h1').textContent).toContain('Welcome to app!');
    }));
  });
```

Now lets see if the test spec passes.

```
  ng test
```
