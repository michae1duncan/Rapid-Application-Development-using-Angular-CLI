# Rapid-Application-Development-using-Angular-CLI
This repository was developed to support the [*Esri Dev Summit 2018* presentation](https://devsummit2018.schedule.esri.com/schedule/433914485) of similar name. This repository provides code samples that will walk you through Angular CLI basics, helping you to quickly standup an Angular app that uses the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Working through the project_apps samples, youâ€™ll create an app, generate components, implement data binding, handle form inputs, create services, set up routing, implement the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and more.

* **[/project_apps](https://github.com/sean-olson-e/Rapid-Application-Development-using-Angular-CLI/tree/master/project_apps)**: demonstration app broken down into development steps. Each of the project_apps directories is accompanied by a README file that will walk you through the given implementation.  Within each of the projects_apps code bases, you will find the code for the sample in the ```src/snippets``` folder.
