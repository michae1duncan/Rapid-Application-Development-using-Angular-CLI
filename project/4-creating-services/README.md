# Using Angular Built-In Directives
There are many built-in directives in Angular, designed to assist with common tasks.  You can browse the. in (The Angular API)[https://angular.io/api]

## Commonly Used Diretives
* [ngIf](https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf) -- Conditionally includes a template based on the value of an expression.
* [ngFor / NgForOf](https://angular.io/api/common/NgForOf) -- The NgForOf directive instantiates a template once per item from an iterable. The context for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set to the current item from the iterable.
* [ngStyle](https://angular.io/api/common/NgStyle) --The styles are updated according to the value of the expression evaluation.
* [ngClass](https://angular.io/api/common/NgClass) -- The CSS classes are updated as follows, depending on the type of the expression evaluation.
